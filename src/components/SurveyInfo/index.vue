        The purpose of this questionnaire is to gather and collect individual experiences that are related to bikes and
        the cycling infrastructure in Aberdeen. As an organisation, BeCycle is interested in facilitating an active
        debate regarding the cycling infrastructure, and, by starting the dialogue (with you and others) we hope to put
        pressure on our politicians. Ultimately, we want them to prioritise cyclists and other modes of active
        transportation when making decisions related to the infrastructure. Which, until now, has not been the case.
